# Bungee Audio Player

This project is a proof of concept audio player based on [Juce](https://juce.com/) which utilizes the 
[Bungee Audio Time Stretcher Library](https://bungee.parabolaresearch.com/)
to provide time stretching and pitch shifting.

**Note**: This implementation utilizes a 'push' approach for processing data unlike the default 'pull' workflow Bungee suggests. This makes it more inline with how most time stretchers available work and is notably useful for audio streams.

Because this project is based on the [Pamplejuce](https://melatonin.dev/manuals/pamplejuce) template, you're welcome to use it as a base project for something like a sampler, or whatever you'd like.

If you found this project useful, please credit this author, I'd greatly appreciate it üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Out of the box, it:

1. Supports C++20.
2. Uses JUCE 8.x as a git submodule (tracking develop).
3. Relies on CMake 3.24.1 and higher for cross-platform building.
4. Ships with custom FIFO Buffer for buffering processed data.
4. Has [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) v3.7.0 for the test framework and runner (not currently used but you're welcome to contribute).

It also contains:

1. A `.gitignore` for all platforms.
2. A `.clang-format` file for keeping code tidy.
3. A `VERSION` file that will propagate through JUCE and your app.
4. A ton of useful comments and options around the CMake config.


Check out the [official Pamplejuce documentation](https://melatonin.dev/manuals/pamplejuce/how-does-this-all-work/) for all the extra features this project inherits as well as how to build it.


## Getting Started

Currently, this project has only been built and tested on Windows. If you'd like to build and contribute the steps to get it working on other OS, please consider contributing.
